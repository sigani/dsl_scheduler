## How to setup the project  
1) Follow these steps https://github.com/antlr/antlr4-tools  
2) run `npm install` to download dependencies (note: i think your node has to be at least version 14 for antlr to work)  
3) run `npm run antlr` to transform the g4 files into js files (should not need to do unless you plan on updating something)  
4) enjoy
