# HOW TO SETUP PROJECT
1. cd into backend  
2. run `npm install`  
3. ask jaren for the env variables and make the env file (this is to limit aws usage because I am using a free account)
    - optional: ask jaren to verify emails too because aws won't let free users send emails to anyone unless i apply for that  
    - otherwise, you can just use jaren's emails (but I guess you wouldn't receive the alerts lol)
    - nevertheless, you can still test callbacks on assigning tasks to other users
4. do `npm run start`  
5. cd into frontend  
6. run `npm install`  
7. run `npm run dev`  
8. open localhost  
9. go BANANAS  
## Note
The checkins are in the backend folder
